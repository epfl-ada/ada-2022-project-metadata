*metADAta: Malin Svenberg, Maresa Fees, Greta Tuori, Valgerdur Jónsdóttir*

## Abstract
Throughout history, women have been marginalised in many communities and in the last few years, gender bias against women has become even more visible in internet applications and online search. One example of such is Google Translate when translating from one language to another. This gender bias that appears online is in fact a reflection of the gender bias in our society. Therefore, we would like to investigate whether there exists a gender bias against women when people play the game of Wikispeedia. In Wikispeedia, people are asked to navigate from a given source article to a certain target article on Wikipedia. The Wikispeedia dataset provides human navigation paths on Wikipedia which we can indeed use to answer whether there exists gender bias against women when users navigate from a given source article to a target article, where the target article relates to women.

## Research questions
To answer the question whether there exists a gender bias against women in the game of Wikispeedia, we aim to answer the following questions:
- Controlling for all confounding factors and only the gender being the difference, are the paths to target articles about women longer than those for men?
    - Do users find the paths that have a target article related to women more difficult than the average difficulty of path navigation? 
    - Is the play duration for target article about women longer than the average play duration?
    - Are there more back clicks in the paths that have a target article about women? 
    - Are there more unfinished paths than finished paths related to articles about women?

## Additional datasets
In order to identify between articles about women and men, since we are only interested in paths that go from a certain source article to a target article either about a man or a woman, we aimed to filter out from the original dataset all target articles about women/men.

### Dataset information
The Wikispeedia dataset contains human navigation paths on Wikipedia, collected through the human-computation game Wikispeedia. In Wikispeedia, users are asked to navigate from a given source to a given target article, by only clicking Wikipedia links. A condensed version of Wikipedia (4,604 articles) is used. In addition to the navigation paths, we provide the full HTML package of this version of Wikipedia, as well as all articles in plaintext.

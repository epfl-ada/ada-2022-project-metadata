# An analysis on gender bias

## Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. Whatâ€™s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Throughout history, women have been marginalised in many communities and in the last few years, gender bias against women has become even more visible in internet applications, such as Google Translate when translating from one language to another. We want to find out if a similar gender bias against women can be found when people navigate from a source article to a target article, where the target article relates to women. So what we want to ask ourselves is the following: Controlling for all confounding factors and only the gender being the difference, are the paths to target articles about women longer than those for men?

Do people playing Wikispeedia find the paths that have a target article related to women more difficult than the average difficulty of path navigation? Is their play duration longer than the average play duration? Are there more back clicks in these paths? Are there more unfinished paths than finished paths related to articles about women?

### Dataset information
The Wikispeedia dataset contains human navigation paths on Wikipedia, collected through the human-computation game Wikispeedia. In Wikispeedia, users are asked to navigate from a given source to a given target article, by only clicking Wikipedia links. A condensed version of Wikipedia (4,604 articles) is used. In addition to the navigation paths, we provide the full HTML package of this version of Wikipedia, as well as all articles in plaintext.
